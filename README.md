# Portfolio
Short portfolio of my coding work 

I began with the header, that has my name and the role in which i would potentially be looking for. 

Followed by the first picture i found of myself on this laptop. In an oval because i thought i would play around with the features abit to familiarise myself.

I added a about me section which i have yet to fill in with anything but i just added lorem ipsom as a place holder for now as i was short on time and didnt want to waste time on activities that werent coding.

Then i had a section for my projects, which i got help from my cousin in order to get it in a '360' format because i thought it would be a good idea but just inturn created alot of white space and made my page look rather empty but this is a learning curve, because of the work that it took to get it to work, it wasnt worth starting again.

Lastly i have a footer section with just my contact details. 

Also i chose the MIT License because i heard its the most used one.
